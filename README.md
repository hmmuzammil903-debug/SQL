# ðŸ§  SQL â€“ Student Course Management System

This repository contains a **PostgreSQL project** that simulates a simple **Student Course Management System**. It includes:

- Table creation (students, courses, enrollments)
- Sample data insertion
- GPA and grade calculations
- Use of joins, views, and conditions
- Final student summary with performance stats

Great for practicing core SQL skills and building beginner-level database logic.
